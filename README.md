# üìñ Odam Blog 
Odam Blog Website


## üñ•Ô∏è Info about the project
* * This project is a blog which allows you to add and delete posts and it was based on the React Tutorial by [Iam](https://github.com/iamshaunjp) (AKA: THE NET NIJA). There were several changes along the project, though. I decided to use the Context API, MirageJS and Axios for didactic purposes, for example. 

## üìò What is in the project?
* This is a project created to approach the fundamentals of React. It is almost a CRUD (It is not a CRUD because the resource of updating was not implemented) using MirageJS, Axios, Context API and React Router.
* In the project, we fetch data from Mirage and share it through components using the Context API. We can navigate through routers using react-router and we can add and delete blogs to the main state variable.
